# Our mission

> **Promote gender diversity in the R-community**

**Why?** **Underrepresentation** of women in the R community

**Where?** Lack of female **leaders**, package **developers**, conference **speakers** and **participants**, **teachers** and **users**!

> Note that all references to women/female in this presentation are usefully inclusively w.r.t. Trans women, genderqueer women and non-binary people who are significantly female identified

---

# Our mission

**Goal**
* Achieve proportionate representation by **Encouraging**, **Inspiring**, **Empowering** current minorities.

**How?**
* **Support** R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential.
* Building a **local and global collaborative network** of R leaders, mentors, learners and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress

---

# Intro to R using RStudio

Open the file `tutorial - Intro to R.R` from tutorial folder

---

# RStudio

# RStudio

Some tips before we start

* shortcut for running a line of code :    ctrl + enter 
* shortcut for running the entire script:  ctrl + shift + enter
* shortcut for `<-`:                       alt + -

> For Mac users: Use cmnd instead of ctrl

**Arithmetic operators:**

* Addition:       +
* Subtraction:    -
* Multiplication: *
* Division:       /
* Exponentiation: ^
* Modulus:        %%

* greater or equal than: >=
* equal to:              ==

# Variables

Variables can be assigned using **<-** or **=**
* **<-** is considered to be the standard

Variable names are case sensitive
* Var != var

Valid variable names include only letters, numbers, _ and .
* They start with letters or .

> Be careful when naming your variables

---

# Types of data

* Numeric or Integers:
  * Quantitative information
  * E.g.: Weight, height, count

* Character
  * String with any type of data
  * E.g.: "Hello", "5", "one"

* Factor
  * Limited number of different values
  * E.g.: Blood type
  
* Logical
  * Represents TRUE or FALSE

---

# Vectors

A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type

```{r}
vector <- c()
```


To index a vector: vector[index]

> Note that R starts counting at 1

---

# Data frames

Create a data frame: `df <- data.frame()`

Access colnames and rownames: `colnames()`, `rownames()`

Access number of columns and rows: `nrow()`, `ncol()`

---

# Plotting

For quick plotting, you can use R's basic functions:

`plot(numeric_x, numeric_y)`

`barplot(numeric_x)`

`hist(factor_x)`

`boxplot(numeric_x ~ factor_y)`

For more advanced plots, use the library **ggplot2**
